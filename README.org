* MooseX::Exporter::Builder

Wrapper around Moose::Exporter to avoid /code duplication/
(creating sub and naming it in proper field)

With [[https://metacpan.org/pod/Sub::Uplevel][Sub::Uplevel]] it also supports proper ~import~ and ~unimport~ chaining

** Motivation

I was bored with maintaining helpers and their registration using proper field.
As *lazy programmer* I prefer typing everything just once:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
as_is helper => sub {
    my ($arg1, ...) = @_;
    ...;
};

with_meta helper2 => sub {
    my ($meta, $arg1, ...) = @_;
    ...;
};
